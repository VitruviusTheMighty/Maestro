# Leonardo Ferrisi 23' - CSC 245
# Grading Contract , Progress Tracking and Portfolio

## Portfolios

Your major deliverable at the end of the term is a portfolio of your work.  This portfolio can be either in the form of a Google Drive folder or a git repository.

*Portfolio located* [**here**](../portfolio.md)

Portfolio will include:

* all course work
  * including before/after versions of every revision
* A Manifest/Readme guiding the reader through the portfolio
* This contract, and any prior versions of the contract
* KWL chart
* A final grade bid, advocating for your why you earned a specific grade according to the terms of your contract.
* A good relevant meme

- [x] You may use the following to seed your contract.


<!-- ### Using samples

There are a few samples provided for you to use as a starting point.   

Note that it's worth considering ahead of time whether you want to take a more guided route, where you are completing clearly designed assignments from me, or whether you are taking a more creating route that leaves more room to customize the details of what you learn at a deeper level.


### Sample Tasks

In addition to the tasks listed in the sample contracts some ideas for things you could add any number of things, including but not limited to:

- Consistently sharing high quality class notes
- Independently elaborating on in-class examples or programming assignments and sharing the code (with John's feedback)
- Writing a clear explainer for your classmates on obtuse math/physics/CS concepts that are covered only lightly in the class. 
- Finding examples of topics covered in other games, comparing them or explaining how they connect to class.
- Recording TikTok videos explaining course material
- Write a critical review of a video game -->

<!-- ## Using this Contract

You *may* also revise it at future points in the term. A revision may:
- change your grade and update work accordingly
- keep the grade, but swap out how it will be earned


You'll hand in an updated copy of this contract, *highlighting any changes* as part of every programming assignment/portfolio check-in.  I will need to approve of any changes before the contract becomes official.  I'll expect you to approach me with any questions or concerns you have along the way.  Regular drop-in hours meetings are a good idea. -->


<!-- ##  Tracking progress

A good contract also has a way for you to track your progress during the term, rather just having end-of-term deliverables.  You can use your KWL chart for this, or use a spreadsheet or other tool. -->
